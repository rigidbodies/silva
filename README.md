## Story:
We are in the glowing time of the past, when nature still rules strongly over the world and the forests stretch across the continents. In the oldest of these forests live the small, ancient people of the Titos. The heart of the forest is the library, which holds the secret knowledge of the forest and is protected by the Titos. But dark shadowy creatures are wreaking havoc in the woods. Now they have reached the oldest forest and discovered the library of the Titos. The shadow creatures feed on books and knowledge, and now they are trying to steal the books of wisdom.  The survival of the forest is threatened! Help the brave SILVA of the Titos to protect the books and knowledge so that the forest can survive.
